## Submitting

Once you are absolutely sure you have met the above requirements, post your project in [#highway-pitstop](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C08S22XRYMU)! Here's what you should include:

```

Once you're done that, fill out the following form:

It'll send over your project to our queue to be approved! When we review it, you'll get a reply on your message in #highway-pitstop!

We'll try to get back to you within 3-4 weekdays.

*Please do not use #highway-pitstop for anything other than submitting*

## Next steps

If you get approved, you'll get an HCB card grant in your email within 12 hours!

If your project was rejected, you'll be pinged in #highway-pitstop with the reason - usually it's small! Once you've made your changes, please fill out the re-review form:

## Submitting your final build

Finished building your project IRL? 

Two things you need to do:

1. Post a demo on Reddit! Here's an [example of a post by @cyao](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1kwx5p7/i_built_the_fpga_raspberry_pi_zero_equivalent/).
2. For those who made a custom project - make a magazine page for it! Instructions on this [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/design/JrUtKGmZKVaT8t2z12oybV/magazine-?node-id=0-1&t=qPMHT9OHuyUDMGj8-1) - we're going to physically print out a magazine, where each page has a project on it.

Then, fill out the [Demo Form](https://forms.hackclub.com/highway-demo) - we'll look at it in a few days and let you know if it's been approved!
